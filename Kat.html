    <p><i>"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing it's best, night and day, to make you everybody else - means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting."</i><br> - E.E.Cummings<br><br>Being born bi-racial meant for me always thinking about how I presented myself, and who I was perceived to be.<br>I was fortunate to have been given two incredible, inquisitve brothers - both were and are creative, curious and contemplative.<br>We grew up in the suburbs, and all knew we would go to college for design.<br>I went to a college in downtown Chicago, and when the loans ran out I moved to New York and applied for internships.<br>My second internship gave me the chance to really explore the production side of fashion, and I quickly realized that this was what I wanted to contribute.<br>Life at some point intervened, and I had a son.<br> My proirities began to shift, and my career along with them.<br> I made the lateral move to button production, where I enjoied full autonomy of the design and production departments.<br>The gentrification of my neighorhood meant again having to look at my priorities, and I soon decided it was time to go home.<br> Through all my comings and goings the internal conversation about who I was, and what impact I was meant to have continued - and that conversation brought me here to I.C. Stars.</p>

    <p style="color:goldenrod">I chose this video because as a girl in middle school I was very shy, and could barely make eye contact. I had a teacher, her name was Ms. Anderson at the time, and she saw how shy I was and enrolled me in what she called a <b>"Special Project"</b>.<br> Me and my classmate Karla were chosen, and this project was for after school, outside of our grades.<br>We had to choose someone to do a reasearch paper on, and then present it. I chose Marian Anderson, because she overcame adversity, was incredibly stylish and traveled the world.<br> As a young woman she was my idol. She also shared the last name of the teacher that changed my life.</p>

    <p style="color:goldenrod">I chose this video because the idea of <b>Self-Care</b> changed my life.
        
        
        As a working mom I carried that mom guilt with me everytime I left the house, and assuaged it at my own expense.<br> I would spend every single minute trying to make events and playdates when I knew I was running on fumes.<br> Even when things were good, I was miserable and just didn't feel like me. 
         Hearing this <b>TED </b>Talk, and knowing the value of "Reconnecting with my breath" changed the way I prioritized everything, and gave me the space to be a happier mother.</p>
